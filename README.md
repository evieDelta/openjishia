# openjishia-legacy

An extraction of some components of a proprietary bot in order to facilitate some partial opensourcing

The code here is a total disaster, i said i'd rewrite it a year ago and never did and just piled more spaghetti on top, so don't expect sanity here

### Running
make a data dir and copy the *.toml.example files into it (removing the .example) and fill them out
then you can go run . to run it
